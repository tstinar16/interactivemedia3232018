	<h2>This is the one song everyone would like to learn: the song that is irresistible: the song that forces men to leap overboard in squadrons even though they see the beached skulls. </h2>

		The song nobody knows because anyone who has heard it is dead and, the others can't remember. Shall I tell you the secret and if I do, will you get me out of this bird suit? 

		<br><br><br>

		I don't enjoy it here squatting on this island, looking picturesque and mythical with these two feathery manicas.

		<br><br><br>

		I don't enjoy singing this trio, fatal and valuable. I will tell the secret to you, to you, only you. Come closer: This song is a cry for help. 

		<br><br><br><br><br><br>

		<h3><em><strong>Help me!</strong></em></h3>

		<br><br><br><br><br><br>

		Only you <br>
		Only you can <br> 
		You are unique <br>
		At last <br> 
		Alas it is a boring song but it works <em>every</em> time.

	<p>this <br> is the one song <br> everyone would like to learn <br>the song that is <b>irresistible</b> the song that <br>forces men to leap overboard in squadrons even though <br>
	they see the beached skulls the song nobody knows <br> because anyone who has heard it is dead <br> and the others can't remember<br> shall I tell you the secret 
	<br> >>>> <br> <br> <<<< <br> 

	and if I do <br> will you get me out <br> of this bird suit? I don't enjoy <br> it here, squatting on this island looking picturesque <br> and mythical with these two feathery <br>manicas I don't enjoy <br> singing This trio <br> fatal and <br> valuable 

	<br> >>>> <br> <br> <<<< <br> 
	I will tell <br> the secret to you <br> to you only you <br>come closer! <br> this song is a cry for help <br> help me! only you, only you can you <br> are unique at last, alas it is a <br> boring song but it <br> works every <br> time</p>

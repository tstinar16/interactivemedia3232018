	<ol>This is the one song everyone would like to learn: the song that is irresistible: </ol>
	<br><br><br><br><br><br>  

	<ol><ol>the song that forces men to leap overboard in squadrons even though they see the beached skulls.</ol></ol>

	<br><br><br><br><br><br>

	<ol><ol><ol>The song nobody knows because anyone who has heard it is dead, and the others can't remember. Shall I tell you the secret and if I do </ol></ol></ol>


	<ol><ol><ol><ol>will you get me out of this bird suit? </ol></ol></ol></ol>
	
	<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

	<ol><ol><ol><ol><ol>I don't enjoy it here squatting on this island looking picturesque and mythical with these two feathery manicas. I don't enjoy singing this trio, fatal and valuable. </ol></ol></ol></ol></ol>


	<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

	<ol><ol><ol><ol>I will tell the secret to you, to you, only you. Come closer. This song is a cry for help: Help me!</ol></ol></ol></ol>

	<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
	
	<ol><ol><ol>Only you, only you can, you are unique at last.</ol></ol></ol></a>

	<ol><em>Alas it is a boring song but it works every time.</em></ol>

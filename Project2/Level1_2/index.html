<head><p> Siren Song <br>by MARGARET ATWOODD</p></head>

<body>
	<p>This is the one song everyone would like to learn: the song that is irresistible: the song that forces men to leap overboard in squadrons even though they see the beached skulls </p>
	<p>The song nobody knows because anyone who has heard it is dead, and the others can't remember. Shall I tell you the secret and if I do, will you</p>
	<p>get me out of this bird suit? I don't enjoy it here squatting on this island looking picturesque and mythical with these </p>
	<p>two feathery manicas, I don't enjoy singing this trio, fatal and valuable I will tell the secret</p>
	
	<p> to you, to you, only you. Come closer. This song </p>
	<p>is a cry for help:</p>
	<p>Help me!</p><br>
	<p>Only you, only you can, you are unique at last.</p>
	<p>Alas it is a boring song </p>
	<p>but it works every time.</p>

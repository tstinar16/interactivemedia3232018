	<div class="one"> This is the one song everyone would like to learn: 
		the song that is irresistible: the song that forces men to leap overboard in squadrons even though they see the beached skulls. </div>

		<div class="two">The song nobody knows because anyone who has heard it is dead, and the others can't remember. </div>
		<div class="three">Shall I tell you the secret and if I do, will you get me out of this bird suit? </div>
		<div class="four">I don't enjoy it here squatting on this island looking picturesque and mythical with these two feathery manicas. </div>
		<div class="five">I don't enjoy singing this trio, fatal and valuable. </div>
		<div class="six">I will tell the secret to you, to you, only you. </div>
		<div class="seven">Come closer </div>
		<div class="sev">Come closer... </div>
		<div class="eight">This song is a cry for help: </div>
		<div class="nine"><h1>HELP ME</h1></div>
		<div class="ten">Only you, only you can, you are unique at last.</div>
		<div class="eleven"> Alas it is a boring song but it works every time.</div>

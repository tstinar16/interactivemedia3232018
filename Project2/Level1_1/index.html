	<p> SIREN SONG <br>by Margaret Atwood</p>

</head>

<body>
	<p>This is the one <b>song</b> everyone would like to learn: the <b>song</b> that is irresistible: the <b>song</b> that forces men to</p>
	<p>l e a p </p>
	<p>overboard in squadrons even though they see the beached skulls </p>
	<p>The <b>song</b> nobody knows because anyone who has heard it</p>
	<p>is dead,</p>
	<p>and the others can't remember. Shall I tell you the secret and if I do, will you get me out of this</p>
	<p>bird suit?</p>
	<p> <b>I</b> don't enjoy it here squatting on this island lOOking picturesque and mythical with these two feathery manicas,</p>
	<p>I don't enjoy singing this trio, fatal</p>
	<p> and valuable</p>
	<p>I will tell the secret to you, to you, only you.</p>
	<p>Come closer.</p>
	<p>this <b>song</b> is a cry for help:</p>
	<p>Help me!</p>
	<p>Only you, only you can, you are unique at last.</p>
	<p>Alas it is a boring <b>song</b> but it works</p>
	<p>every time.</p>

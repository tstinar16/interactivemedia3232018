	This is the one song everyone would like to learn: the song that is irresistible: the song that forces men to leap overboard in squadrons even though they see the beached skulls.
	The song nobody knows because anyone who has heard it is dead, and the others can't remember. Shall I tell you the secret and if I do, will you get me out of this bird suit? 
	I don't enjoy it here squatting on this island looking picturesque and mythical with these two feathery manicas. I don't enjoy singing this trio, fatal and valuable. I will tell the secret to you, to you, only you. Come closer. This song is a cry for help: Help me!
	Only you, only you can, you are unique at last.</a>
	
	<em>Alas it is a boring song but it works every time.</em>

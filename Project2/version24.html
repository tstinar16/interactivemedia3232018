<div class="one"> <a id="C4">This</a> is the one song everyone would like to learn.
	<div class="one"> The song that is irresistible the song that forces men to leap overboard in squadrons, 

	<div class="one">even though they see the beached skulls

	<div class="one">The song nobody knows because anyone who has heard it is dead 
	<div class="one">and the others can't remember. 
	<div class="one">Shall I tell you the secret and if I do will you get me out of this bird suit? 
	<div class="one">I don't enjoy it here squatting on this island looking picturesque and mythical,
	<div class="one">with these two feathery manicas.
	<div class="one">I don't enjoy singing this trio fatal and valuable. 
	<div class="one">I will tell the secret to you to you only you. Come closer. 
	<div class="one">This song is a cry for help 
	<div class="one">Help me. 
	<div class="one">Only you, 
	<div class="one">only you can, 
	<div class="one">you are unique at last. 
	<div class="one">Alas it is a boring song,
	<div class="one">but it works every <a href="#top">time.
